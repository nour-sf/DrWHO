This new database combines the information for the seven principal atmospheric absorbers and twenty-one additional molecular species previously contained on the AFGL atmospheric absorption line parameter compilation and on the trace gas compilation. In addition to updating the parameters on earlier editions of the compilation, new parameters have been added to this edition such as the self-broadened halfwidth, the temperature dependence of the air-broadened halfwidth, and the transition probability. The database contains 348043 entries between 0 and 17,900 cm{\textminus}1. A fortran program is now furnished to allow rapid access to the molecular transitions and for the creation of customized output. A separate file of molecular cross sections of eleven heavy molecular species, applicable for qualitative simulation of transmission and emission in the atmosphere, has also been provided.},

	journal = {The Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series},
	abstract = {Many high-contrast coronagraph designs have recently been proposed. In this paper, their suitability for direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets is reviewed. We also develop a linear algebra based model of coronagraphy that can both explain the behavior of existing coronagraphs and quantify the coronagraphic performance limit imposed by fundamental physics. We find that the maximum theoretical throughput of a coronagraph is equal to 1 minus the nonaberrated noncoronagraphic PSF of the telescope. We describe how a coronagraph reaching this fundamental limit may be designed, and how much improvement over the best existing coronagraph design is still possible. Both the analytical model and numerical simulations of existing designs also show that this theoretical limit rapidly degrades as the source size is increased: the "highest performance" coronagraphs, those with the highest throughput and smallest inner working angle (IWA), are the most sensitive to stellar angular diameter. This unfortunately rules out the possibility of using a small IWA (<λ/d) coronagraph for a terrestrial planet imaging mission. Finally, a detailed numerical simulation that accurately accounts for stellar angular size, zodiacal and exozodiacal light is used to quantify the efficiency of coronagraph designs for direct imaging of extrasolar terrestrial planets in a possible real observing program. We find that in the photon noise-limited regime, a 4 m telescope with a theoretically optimal coronagraph is able to detect Earth-like planets around 50 stars with 1 hr exposure time per target (assuming 25\% throughput and exozodi levels similar to our solar system). We also show that at least two existing coronagraph design can approach this level of performance in the ideal monochromatic case considered in this study.}

    abstract = { Over the last two decades, several thousand exoplanets have been identified, and their study has become a high scientific priority. Direct imaging of nearby exoplanets and the circumstellar disks in which they form and evolve is challenging due to the high contrast ratio and small angular separation relative to the central star. Exoplanets are typically within 1 arcsec of, and between 4 and 10 orders of magnitude fainter than, the stars they orbit. To meet these challenges, ground-based telescopes must be equipped with extreme adaptive optics (ExAO) systems optimized to acquire high-contrast images of the immediate surrounding of nearby bright stars. Current ExAO systems have the sensitivity to image thermal emission from young massive planets in near-IR, while future systems deployed on Giant Segmented Mirror Telescopes will image starlight reflected by lower-mass rocky planets. Thanks to rapid progress in optical coronagraphy, wavefront control, and data analysis techniques, direct imaging and spectroscopic characterization of habitable exoplanets will be within reach of the next generation of large ground-based telescopes. }

abstract = "The Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme-AO (SCExAO) system is designed for high contrast coronagraphic imaging at small angular separations, and is scheduled to see first light on the Subam Telescope in early 2011. The wavefront control architecture for SCExAO is optimized for scattered light control and calibration at small angular separations, and is described in this paper. Key subsystems for the SCExAO wavefront control architecture have been successfully demonstrated, and we report results from these tests and discuss their role in the SCExAO system. Among these subsystems, a technique which can calibrate and remove static and slow speckles which traditionally limit high contrast detections is discussed. A visible light lab prototype system at Subam Telescope recently demonstrated speckle halo reduction to 2e-7 contrast within 2 λ/D, and removal of static coherent speckles to 3e-9 contrast.",

However, imaging the innermost region of such discs (a zone critical to planet formation) is challenging for traditional observational techniques (such as near-IR imaging and coronagraphy) due to the relatively long wavelengths involved and the area occulted by the coronagraphic mask. Here, we introduce a new instrument – Visible Aperture-Masking Polarimetric Interferometer for Resolving Exoplanetary Signatures (VAMPIRES) – which combines non-redundant aperture-masking interferometry with differential polarimetry to directly image this previously inaccessible innermost region. By using the polarization of light scattered by dust in the disc to provide precise differential calibration of interferometric visibilities and closure phases, VAMPIRES allows direct imaging at and beyond the telescope diffraction limit. Integrated into the SCExAO (Subaru Coronagraphic Extreme Adaptive Optics) system at the Subaru telescope, VAMPIRES operates at visible wavelengths (where polarization is high) while allowing simultaneous infrared observations conducted by HICIAO. Here, we describe the instrumental design and unique observing technique and present the results of the first on-sky commissioning observations, validating the excellent visibility and closure-phase precision which are then used to project expected science performance metrics.}",
